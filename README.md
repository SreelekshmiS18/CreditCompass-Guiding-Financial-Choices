# CreditCompass-Guiding-Financial-Choices
This repository introduces **CreditCompass: Guiding Financial Choices**, a sophisticated tool designed to assess credit risk using advanced machine learning techniques. The project focuses on predicting the likelihood of credit default among applicants based on various demographic and financial attributes.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: CreditCompass aims to provide insights into the creditworthiness of individuals by analyzing a dataset that includes features such as age, sex, job type, housing status, savings accounts, checking account balances, credit amount, loan duration, and loan purpose.
- **User Interface**: The application features an intuitive graphical user interface built with **Tkinter**, allowing users to easily input applicant data and receive immediate predictions regarding credit risk.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset to identify trends and patterns that influence credit risk.
- **Data Preprocessing**: This phase includes cleaning the data and preparing it for modeling, which involves handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Models**: CreditCompass utilizes several machine learning algorithms to evaluate credit risk:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Ada Boost Classifier**

## Model Performance

The accuracy of each model is as follows:

| Model                          | Accuracy |
|--------------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier       | 73.1%    |
| Support Vector Classifier      | 71.3%    |
| Logistic Regression            | 70.1%    |
| Ada Boost Classifier           | 73.0%    |

These accuracy scores demonstrate the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting credit risk.

CreditCompass not only showcases the application of machine learning in financial decision-making but also provides a practical tool for users to evaluate credit risk based on their input data, ultimately guiding them towards informed financial choices.
